This folder contains image assets used by the site.

Files present:
- `logo.svg` — main logo (used in header and footer).

How to replace:
- Replace `logo.svg` with your real logo using the same filename to avoid editing `index.html`.
- Recommended formats: `SVG` (preferred). For raster images (`PNG`/`JPG`), provide ~96–256 px for header usage and 32–64 px for footer usage.

Favicon notes:
- If you want a browser favicon, add `assets/favicon.ico` or `assets/favicon.png` and add a link in the `<head>` of `index.html`:
  `<link rel="icon" href="assets/favicon.ico">`

Accessibility:
- Use meaningful `alt` text for raster images. SVGs can include `<title>` and `<desc>` elements for accessibility.
